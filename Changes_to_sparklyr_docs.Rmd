# Pipelines

## Traditional Spark ML Pipelines
Difference between fit and transform?

Example with String Indexer

The vector assembler

Acknowledge more complicated pipelines ... later

## The R ml_* Wrappers

Targetted at R users. Take care of some portions of the traditional spark pipeline (just like R functions.) For example, one hot encoding.

What is a sparklyr ml_model object vs spark model object?

### Implications for Cross-Language Serialization

It is hard! See the pyspark - sparklyr example

## dplyr pipelines
Allow you to combine Spark SQL, FT, and R ml_wrappers to achieve the equivalent of complicated Spark workflow in less code

Think of a ml_* as being a mini-pipeline inside of a bigger pipeline?

When are things evaluated?

When to use sdf_register?
